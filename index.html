<h3>A New Anharmonic Lattice Dynamics Calculator Demonstrated on Amorphous SiGe<\h3>
<p>Electronics require precise manipulation of electrical signals which are 
often modulated through semiconductors and insulators. Heat and electron transport are fundamentally coupled properties thus better understanding of thermal transport in exotic semiconductor variants, like nanostructured and amorphous materials, could solve modern engineering problems like heat management in three dimensional integrated circuits. Here we present kALDo, an anharmonic lattice dynamics calculator, which allows for nanoscale description of heat transport across the entire span of solids. The calculator employs parallel computing to quickly enumerate the phononic heat transport at any temperature with full incorporation of quantum effects. As a demonstration, we provide a deeper look into mechansims behind the isotope effect on thermal transport in amorphous SiGe glasses. The mode-resolved data provided by kALDo shows heavy-atom doped, amorphous materials suffer low frequency localization similar to their 
crystal analogues. The total thermal conductivity drops by ~30% from just 5% Ge dopant concentration.</p>
